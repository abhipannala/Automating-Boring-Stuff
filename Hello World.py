## What do I know? A lot of basics! Not bad :P
## THis program says hello and asks my name
print('Hello world!')
print('What is your name?')
myName = input()
print('It is good to meet you, '+ myName)
print('The length of your name is: {} characters'.format(len(myName)))


## The one thing I'd have to google in the above is the input() function. input takes the input values as string.
